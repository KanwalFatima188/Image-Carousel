# Image-Carousel
A carousel (also known as a slider or image slider) is a dynamic UI component that allows users to view multiple pieces of content—such as images, videos, or text—in a rotating or sliding manner. It's often used for displaying a sequence of content in a limited space while keeping the user engaged.
